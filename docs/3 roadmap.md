# MVP Roadmap — Dental Appointment Scheduling Platform

## Roadmap Objective

Deliver a functional MVP that validates whether dentists are willing to replace Google Calendar with a purpose-built scheduling tool, focusing on clarity, control, and daily operational usability.

The roadmap prioritizes learning speed over feature completeness.

## Guiding Principles

- Ship value early
- Validate assumptions continuously
- Avoid overengineering
- Optimize for real-world workflows
- Treat MVP as an experiment, not a product launch

---

## Phase 0 — Product Foundation

### Goal
Establish product direction and delivery standards.

### Scope

- Product Vision
- MVP Scope Definition
- Delivery Conventions
- Epic breakdown

- Blocked time prevents booking
- No overlapping appointments

---

## Phase 3 — Operational Workflow

### Epics

- Epic 4 — Appointment Lifecycle  
- Epic 5 — Search & Filtering  

### Goal

Support real clinic operations.

### Key Deliverables

- Cancel / complete appointments
- Appointment history
- Search by patient name
- Filters by doctor, date, status

### Success Signals

- Clinics manage full appointment lifecycle
- Staff can quickly locate visits

---

## Phase 4 — MVP Validation

### Goal

Validate Value + Adoption.

### Activities

- Onboard 1–3 pilot clinics
- Observe real scheduling behavior
- Collect qualitative feedback
- Identify friction points

### Key Questions

- Do doctors stop using Google Calendar?
- Is the system used daily?
- Does it reduce scheduling confusion?

---

## Phase 5 — Post-MVP Decision

### Options

- Iterate on UX based on feedback
- Add patient self-booking
- Introduce basic analytics
- Explore pricing
- Pivot based on learning

Decisions driven by real usage, not assumptions.

---

## MVP Completion Criteria

The MVP is considered successful if:

- Doctors use the system as primary scheduling tool
- Appointments are managed end-to-end
- Google Calendar is no longer required
- Users report improved clarity and control

Failure to reach these signals triggers reassessment of product direction.
